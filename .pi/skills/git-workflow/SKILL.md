# Git Workflow

This project uses **Graphite** for stacked PRs. Always use `gt` commands, never raw `git commit`.

## Commit Message Format

```text
<type>(<scope>): <subject> (<ticket-id>)
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

### Rules

1. **Ticket ID is required** — appended in parentheses at the end of the subject line. Always ask the user for the ticket ID if not provided. Never invent a ticket ID.
2. **Type** must be one of: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `refactor`, `ci`, `docs`, `test`, `perf`, `wip`.
3. **Scope** — a short noun describing the area of the codebase (e.g., `auth`, `chat`, `api`). Required for `feat` and `fix`; optional for other types. For `chore` commits without a specific scope (e.g., release, tooling), use a generic scope: `chore(main): release 1.8.0`.
4. **Subject** is lowercase, imperative mood, no period at end.
5. **Body** (optional) — separated by blank line, explains *what* and *why*. Bullet points with `-`, wrap at ~72 chars.
6. **Footer** (optional) — references, breaking changes (`BREAKING CHANGE: ...`), or co-authors.

### Examples

```text
feat(chat): add streaming response support (TASK-42)

- Buffer chunks and flush on newline boundaries
- Add backpressure handling for slow clients

Refs: TASK-40
```

```text
fix(auth): prevent token refresh race condition (TASK-99)
```

```text
wip(sources): add source entity and repository port (TASK-1)
```

## WIP vs Semantic Types — Changelog Hygiene

Projects using **release-please** auto-generate changelogs from squash-merged PR titles on `main`. Only semantic types (`feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `perf`, `docs`, `ci`, `chore`, `test`) appear in the changelog. The `wip` type is **excluded from the changelog and does not trigger version bumps**.

### When to use `wip:`

Use `wip:` for any PR that is **part of a larger feature but does not complete it**. This is the default for stacked PRs in a multi-branch feature:

```text
wip(sources): add source entity and repository port (TASK-1)        ← stack branch 1
wip(sources): implement source ingestion use case (TASK-1)           ← stack branch 2
feat(sources): add source management API and UI (TASK-1)             ← final branch, completes the feature
```

Only the last PR uses `feat:` — that's the one that appears in the changelog as a single entry.

### When to use semantic types

Use `feat:`, `fix:`, etc. when the PR **delivers a complete, user-visible change** on its own:

- A standalone bug fix → `fix(auth): correct date validation (TASK-2)`
- A self-contained feature in a single PR → `feat(agents): add agent install page (TASK-3)`
- CI/tooling change → `ci: add dead code workflow`

### Rule of thumb

> If this PR were the only one merged, would the change make sense to a user reading the changelog? If yes → semantic type. If no → `wip:`.

## Branching & Stacking

The worktree branch (if using worktrees) is the **base branch**. Graphite stacks are built on top of it.

### New commit → new stacked branch

Each logical unit of work gets its own `gt create`:

```bash
# 1. Stage changes
git add <files>

# 2. Verify what's staged
git status --short

# 3. Create a new stacked branch (auto-stacks on current branch)
gt create -m "<type>(<scope>): <description> (<ticket-id>)"

# 4. If pre-commit hooks fail, fix issues and retry with gt modify
```

### Amending the current branch

Use when fixing QA findings, addressing review feedback, or correcting issues on the current branch:

```bash
# 1. Stage fixes
git add <files>

# 2. Amend the current stacked branch (folds changes into existing commit)
gt modify -m "<type>(<scope>): <description> (<ticket-id>)"

# 3. This automatically restacks any descendant branches
```

Note: `gt modify` without `--commit` amends the existing commit. With `--commit` it creates an additional commit on the branch — that's not what we want for fixes.

### Pushing to remote

**Never use raw `git push`** — always use `gt submit`. Raw pushes bypass Graphite's metadata and desynchronize remote base branches, causing merge conflicts on GitHub.

**Always push the full stack** — never push a single branch. Pushing only one branch after a restack or amend leaves descendant branches' remote refs stale (old SHAs), which causes duplicate-commit merge conflicts the next time someone restacks a child branch.

```bash
# Always use --stack to push all branches in the stack
gt submit --stack --force --no-interactive
```

Use `--force` to ensure remote refs are updated even if Graphite thinks they're current. Add `--publish` to take PRs out of draft.

### Rules

- Each logical unit of work gets its own `gt create` — one stacked branch per batch/task
- Fixes and amendments use `gt modify`, never `gt create`
- Never use `--no-verify` — let the hooks run
- Never use raw `git commit` — always go through `gt`
- Never use raw `git push` — always go through `gt submit`

## Pre-commit Hooks

Projects typically enforce via pre-commit hooks:

- **Commit message must include a ticket ID** (validated by `commit-msg` hook)
- **Commit message must start with a valid type** (`feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `wip`, etc.)
- **Linting, formatting, type-checking** on staged files
- **Complexity checks** (if configured)

If complexity fails, split the offending function into smaller units before retrying.
